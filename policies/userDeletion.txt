For a crowdsourced cafeteria app, I'd suggest Option 1 (SET NULL) because:

✅ Users can always delete their accounts (GDPR compliance)
✅ Valuable location data isn't lost
✅ Other users' measurements are preserved
✅ Simple to implement

Option 1: SET NULL (Recommended for crowdsourced data)
Keep locations but anonymize the creator:

sql
CONSTRAINT fk_location_creator 
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by_user_id) 
    REFERENCES users(user_id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL
Result: Cafeterias remain, but created_by_user_id becomes NULL (anonymous contribution)
