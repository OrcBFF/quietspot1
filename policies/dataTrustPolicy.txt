QuietSpot Data Trust Policy
============================

This document explains how QuietSpot determines noise level predictions for each cafeteria
based on measurement history and data freshness.

Policy Overview
---------------
QuietSpot uses a tiered system that adapts prediction sophistication based on:
- Age of most recent measurement
- Total number of historical measurements
- Time-of-day and day-of-week patterns


Tier 1: Fresh Data (< 60 minutes old)
======================================
Confidence: HIGHEST
Method: Direct measurement

When a cafe has a measurement less than 60 minutes old, we trust it completely.
No prediction algorithms needed - we show the actual measured value.

Example: Cafe measured at 65 dB 30 minutes ago → Display: 65 dB


Tier 2: Confident Prediction (40+ measurements)
================================================
Confidence: HIGH
Method: Advanced temporal filtering with exponential decay

This tier uses sophisticated analysis for cafes with substantial measurement history.

Filtering:
- Time-of-day matching (e.g., only use 2-4pm data to predict 3pm noise)
- Weekday vs weekend patterns (Saturdays differ from Tuesdays)
- Last 30 days of data only

Weighting:
- Exponential time decay: newer measurements weighted more heavily
- Recent 14 days: 2x weight multiplier
- Creates smooth curve favoring recent trends

Best for: Popular cafes with consistent crowdsourcing


Tier 3: Moderate Confidence (20-39 measurements)
=================================================
Confidence: MEDIUM
Method: Time period filtering with recency weighting

This tier uses simpler temporal analysis for cafes with moderate history.

Filtering:
- Time period matching only (broader time windows)
- Last 30 days of data

Weighting:
- Recency weighting applied (but simpler than Tier 2)
- No weekday/weekend distinction

Best for: Moderately popular cafes building measurement history


Tier 4: Limited Data (< 20 measurements)
=========================================
Confidence: LOW
Method: Simple average

For new cafes or those with sparse data, we use a basic average of all
available measurements.

No filtering or weighting applied.

Best for: Newly added cafes or rarely visited locations


Implementation Notes
====================

1. Confidence Display:
   Consider showing users the confidence level in the UI so they understand
   prediction reliability (e.g., "High confidence" badge or "Limited data" warning)

2. Data Decay:
   Older measurements naturally become less relevant. The exponential decay
   ensures cafe environment changes (renovations, policy changes) are reflected.

3. Cold Start Problem:
   New cafes start at Tier 4 and improve as users contribute measurements.
   Encourage early adopters to take multiple measurements!

4. Temporal Patterns:
   Cafes have predictable noise patterns:
   - Morning coffee rush (8-10am): busy/loud
   - Afternoon lull (2-4pm): quieter
   - Weekend mornings: different crowd patterns
   
   Higher tiers capture these patterns automatically.


Measurement Thresholds
=======================
Fresh measurement cutoff: 60 minutes
High confidence threshold: 40+ measurements  
Medium confidence threshold: 20-39 measurements
Low confidence threshold: < 20 measurements
Historical window: 30 days
Recent data boost: Last 14 days (2x weight)


Future Improvements
===================
- Consider special events (holidays, exam periods)
- Factor in weather data (outdoor seating noise)
- Machine learning to discover cafe-specific patterns
- User feedback loop to validate predictions
